                            <p>
                                <em>College roommates want something that will track their house/room chores and roommate responsibilities so that they can stay organized and establish ground rules of their living space.</em>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="the-idea">
                            <h3>The Idea</h3>
                            <p>
                                In order to help solve this problem, I originally thought about creating a mobile application that college roommates could use to manage all of their shared-living space responsibilities no matter where they are at. Users could make an account, invite their roommates to the app, assign their roommates and themselves chores, message their roommates, and assign their roommates and themselves supplies to buy.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="audience">
                            <h3>The Audience</h3>
                            <p>
                                While my primary audience are college students, this application could also be used by anyone who simply wants to manage their house chores and stay connected with the people who they are living with. That can be recent college graduates who live in shared living spaces, travelling groups who share temporary living spaces while they travel, and residents or co- operative living situations.
                            </p>

                        <p>
                            At first, I thought about the topics and agreements that my friend had on his house’s white board. On his white board, his roommates and him had the house rules written, everyone’s weekly chore to do, the washing cycle, and the agenda for cleaning among other things. After seeing all of these, I quickly reflected on my experience living with many college roommates since I began my college career. I knew for sure that in all of my experiences, having written agreements about house norms was important because it allowed my roommates and I the opportunity to respect each other and not perform any activities that annoyed the rest of the roommates. Also, establishing a cleaning/chore schedule is very important so that the roommates always know when they need to perform a task to ensure that the house is clean, and everyone is doing their part. Lastly, from my experience, keeping track of shared house supplies and establishing a consistent cycle with roommates to purchase shared house supplies for the common living space is necessary to ensure that everyone spends the same amount of money house supplies.
                            So in my first few wireframes, I decided to focus developing these 3 main features for my app.
