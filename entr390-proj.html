                            <p>
                                <em>College roommates want something that will track their house/room chores and roommate responsibilities so that they can stay organized and establish ground rules of their living space.</em>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="the-idea">
                            <h3>The Idea</h3>
                            <p>
                                In order to help solve this problem, I originally thought about creating a mobile application that college roommates could use to manage all of their shared-living space responsibilities no matter where they are at. Users could make an account, invite their roommates to the app, assign their roommates and themselves chores, message their roommates, and assign their roommates and themselves supplies to buy.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="audience">
                            <h3>The Audience</h3>
                            <p>
                                While my primary audience are college students, this application could also be used by anyone who simply wants to manage their house chores and stay connected with the people who they are living with. That can be recent college graduates who live in shared living spaces, travelling groups who share temporary living spaces while they travel, and residents or co- operative living situations.
                            </p>
