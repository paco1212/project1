                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    During my senior year of high school, I interned at Fjord, part of Accenture Interactive, in Chicago, Illinois for 9 months. During my time there, I was able to shadow interaction designers, visual designers, and project managers, to learn about the design processes and methodologies.

                    During the last 3 months of my internship, I began a self-initiated User Experience project. During this time, I was applying to colleges and universities. The entire college application process is very tedious and stressful. However, I had a very bad experience because each university had their own protocols and processes for notifying students about their college admissions. I was upset that I had to create accounts for college portals to find out about my college admissions decisions. So I had an idea: what if I conduct research about the college application processes and design a solution that will improve the college admissions experience? 
                    
                    So with the help of my mentors from Fjord, I began to conduct research about the college application process.

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>
                        Interviewed 6 current high school seniors to learn about their college application process
                        Evaluated and compared 4 different college portals from 4 existing universities
                        Evaluated and compared college college search sites such as Cappex.com, FastWeb.com, Zinch.com
                        Sent surveys to high school seniors to find out what the life of a high school senior was like.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                        â€‹Based on this preliminary research, I analyzed my data and created a Persona. After the persona was done, I made a survey and sent it out to my high school friends to find out what their daily life was like. I did this to map map out the life of a high school senior who is currently in the college application phase. Based on the insights from the surveys, I began a User Journey map.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Key Findings:</b>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The average student created 5 online portals to view college-related information for 5 different colleges and universities</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Biggest issue: Keeping track of passwords</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>The average student applied to 12 colleges and universities</li>
                            <li>Students are frustrated about creating multiple online accounts and also receiving information through the email</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Would prefer to have one single platform to get the information they are seeking</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>CommonApp.org and Cappex.com do a good job of connecting multiple universities and colleges across the United States of America in one single platform.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        
                        It was through this data analysis and interpretation where I began to notice trends: many students also have multiple accounts to view their admissions decisions and other information about the colleges and universities. I got inspiration from Cappex.com and CommonApp.org to build a college-access hub where students only have to create on account to view ALL of their college-related information of the specific colleges and university that the students applied to.
                </p>

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>
                    Once I finished analyzing the data, I began to sketch low-fidelity wireframes. The key features I was focusing on were:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Landing Pages for universities and colleges</li>
                        <li>User Home Page</li>
                        <li>Financial Aid Page</li>
                    </ul>
                        
                </p>

                <h2>Prototype</h2>
                <p>
                    After iterating through some sketches of the main features and functionalities of the hub I was creating, I used InVision to build a low-fidelity prototype. After getting feedback from my mentors, I began to build another low-fidelity prototype on Axure to get a better feel about the interface.  I then used these mock ups to add visual designs and color  to bring my design to life. I used Adobe InDesign to add color to my prototype. I worked closely with a visual designer to develop a plan of execution and get feedback on my designs. 
                </p>

                <h2>Deliverable</h2>
                <p>
                    Once I finished adding color and life to the prototype, I had presented the product to my mentors and received feedback. This concluded my 9-month internship at Fjord, Part of Accenture Interactive.
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Working on the project was a great experience and sparked my interest in pursuing a degree in User Experience Design at the University of Michigan after my internship came to an end. I learned a lot about the design world and processes, while also developing my hard and soft skills.
